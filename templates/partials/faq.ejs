            What if I'm not eligible to vote?
          </h1>
          <p>
            If you're not on the eligible voters list, the system will
            inform you immediately after authentication. Only
            contributors who meet the contribution requirements can
            register.

          <p>
            Yes! If you already have an email registered, you can update
            it by going through the registration process again. A new
            pull request will be created with your updated information.

            After registration, you'll receive a direct link to the pull
            request created on your behalf. You can track its status and
            see when it gets merged into the official registry.
